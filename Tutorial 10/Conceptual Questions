Conceptual Questions
1.Explain what MPI is, what are it’s benefits?

MPI is a library of routines that can be used to create parallel programs in C and attempts to be practical , portable, efficient and flexible. It is considered a standard, it portable so source code does not need to be heavily modified to work on different platforms. Additionally, it can exploit hardware features to optimize performance.  

2.Explain briefly how MPI supports running on separate computers in a cluster.

MPI  supports distributed program execution on heterogeneous hardware with use of collective operations so that they perform as a group on a group of processes.

3. Name four MPI data types (hint they all start with MPI_).

MPI_CHAR
MPI_WCHAR
MPI_SHORT
MPI_INT

4. Read the documentation for and explain the MPI_Bcast function.

MPI_Bcast is a data movement operation which sends a message from the process with rank “root” to all other processes in the group.

5. Read the documentation for and explain the MPI_Send and MPI_Recv functions.

MPI_Send rs a basic blocking send operation that returns only after the application buffer in the sending task is free for reuse.  MPI_Revc receives a message and blocks until the requested data is available in the application buffer in the receiving task.
